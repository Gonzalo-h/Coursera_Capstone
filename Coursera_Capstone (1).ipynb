This is crucial \nsince the different parameters will need different datasets and diverse approaches on how to search for data, collect data and, finally, analyze the data.\n\n\nEvery major city shares aspects of daily life of its citizens because of globalization, multiculturalism and population, but, since these cities are located, not only in different countries, \nbut also in different continents and share different values and ways of life it is interesting to search for those things many cities around the globe have in common. With that in mind, this\nproject will evaluate:\n\n\n\n- Number of bars and restaurants\n\n.\n\n- Number of locals dedicated to night life\n\n.\n\n- Number of museums, theaters or other cultural spaces\n\n.\n\n- Number of parks and green areas\n\n.\n\n- Every other aspect considered important in the proceding of this study\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## 2. Real examples used for this project"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "\nFor this type of projects it is important to use real life data and examples in order to use all the knowledge adquired on the previous courses for a real life based experiment. And to provide the data that will be analyzed the two cities\nwhose neighborhoods will be compared are: Madrid and Paris.\n\nI have decided to compare these two cities for several reasons:\n\n\n- Since they are two major global cities it will be useful to analyze globalization and how it has affected different cities around the globe\n\n.\n\n- Being both cities european, it is also interesting to analyze how two different cities in Europe have changed throughout the years and how similar and dissimilar they have become in different aspects shared by all major cities\n\n.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## 3. Conclusions on problem introduction and first approach"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "\nWe have analyzed how we will proceed with the 'battle of the neighborhoods' assignment. But, although this is a mere students project, this kind of studies of different neighborhoods in a city are important to companies operating\nin those countries in order to perform market analysis and search for the best places to install their businesses.\n\nThese studies give a wide view on what are the preferences of the citizens living in the different cities and neighborhoods, what are their ways of buying, the kind of entertainment they look for and, in conclusion, everything that give the company the possibilities of obtaining benefits from the future customers.\n\nSince this study gives a general view on how the different neighborhoods are structured, the target audiences of this study are very wide, including:\n\n\n- Owners of restaurants of bars that may want to open new establishments and want to search for a location with a lower number of them\n\n.\n\n- Shops owners that may want to rent a local in a more central or shopping/tourist-likely parts of the city\n\n.\n\n- Investigators performing different social studies\n\n.\n\n- Even public institutions as local governments/city councils that want to improve services, improve the touristic appeal and make life more confortable for their citizens\n\n.\n\n\nIn conclusion, this study will cover a wide range of aspects involving neighborhoods and cities and it is very useful also for a wide range of actors and targeted audiences."}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.10", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
