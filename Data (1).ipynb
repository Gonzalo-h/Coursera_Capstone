With the use of datasets in websites like Wikipedia (mainly because of its clearness) it is possible to obtain:\n\n\n- The divisions of Madrid and Paris in their respective neighborhoods\n\n.\n\n- The number of restaurants, bars, cultural centers, green spaces, etc.\n\n.\n\nAnd the use of a unique tool to gather all the information needed for both cities, gives a more precise tool to show similarities and dissimilarities since the software used is the same, reducing \nerrors and misunderstandings."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": " "}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## 2.

But, to increase\nthe scope of this study, it also gives some clues on how two cities that have evolved in differen countries through history, in the same continent have change and adapted to a more complex, open and diverse world as we live in\n\n.\n"}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.10", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
