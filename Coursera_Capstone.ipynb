Practice the ways of searching for data in datasets on the internet\n\n\n2. Analyze the data using different techniques and tools\n\n\n3. Practice with the use of visualization tools\n\n\n4. Use every concept involving the data science evaluation process to extract information and conclusions about the subject studied, in this case the similarities and dissimilarities\nbetween two diferent neighborhoods and, with a wider point of view, the similarities and dissimilarities of major cities in different countries as well.\n\n\nTo analyze the different aspects that make two multicultural, diverse and inclusive cities similar it is important to establish the main parameters this study will be based on. This is crucial \nsince the different parameters will need different datasets and diverse approaches on how to search for data, collect data and, finally, analyze the data.\n\n\nEvery major city shares aspects of daily life of its citizens because of globalization, multiculturalism and population, but, since these cities are located, not only in different countries, \nbut also in different continents and share different values and ways of life it is interesting to search for those things many cities around the globe have in common. With that in mind, this\nproject will evaluate:\n\n\n1. Number of bars and restaurants\n\n\n2. Number of locals dedicated to night life\n\n\n3. Number of museums, theaters or other cultural spaces\n\n\n4. Number of parks and green areas\n\n\n5. Every other aspect considered important in the proceding of this study\n\n\n"}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.10", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
