Where have we obtained all this data from (datasets, wikipedia, etc.)\n\n\nTo perform the correct analysis of this study, it is necessary to find correct datasets that define every parameter used. For this study it will be firstly used websites like wikipedia to\ngather, in this case, information of number and location of each neighborhood in both cities chosen to be analyzed.\n\nHaving the divisions of each city in their respective neighborhoods and the precise locations (in matter of latitude and longitude) it is now necessary to gather data involving the parameters\nchosen to perform the study: bars, restaurants, social locals, museums, parks, etc. For this purpose and, as suggested in the project instructions, it will be used the foursquare program\nimplemented in the python library.\n\n\n2. How we have analyzed this data (foursquare to obtain data more precisely and number of places to compare, and with maps)\n\n\nUsing foursquare it is possible to analyze the different parameters that show similarities and dissimilarities between different cities depending on the neighborhoods. To show the results in\na more clear way, the use of different visualization tools such as maps or diagrams will be very important to comunicate in a more understanding way with the reader.\n\n\n3. How have we analyzed how similar are they (comparing all numbers and also comparing neighborhoods between those in the center and those outside the cities)\n\n\nHaving gathered all the data needed to perform this study, it is necessary to find the best ways to compare the different parameters between neighborhoods in those cities:\n\n- Firstly, comparing the raw general numbers\n\n\n- Secondly, analyzing which neighborhoods in each city are similar in terms of the analyzed parameters and also the location of these neighborhoods (which will be studied thanks to the maps \ncreated perviously)\n\n\n- Finally, put together every result obtained and analyse it in a more general and wider way"}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.10", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
